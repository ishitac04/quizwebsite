#What it is/does 
My project is called Quiz Website, where I created a trivia quiz and personality quiz using JavaScript, HTML and CSS where you can answer questions and get a score or personality result (kind of like buzzfeed?)

#Why I made it
I made the project to try to experiment with a different type project to my usual pixel games, and because I wanted to make a more basic webpage (which ended up being way harder than I thought :( ). Also the personality quiz section is a more advanced version of one of my first ever projects so I made it for memories I guess lol :)

#How I made it
I mostly used CSS for the elements and divs (as well as HTML), and then used JavaScript to add the programming where it registers answers and checks if they are correct.

#What I struggled with and what I learned
I struggled with a lot of the programming since I had the constant issue of the questions being removed from the array, making the code break down. I also spent some time trying to fix the same simple errors using different (probably messy) methods. In the end, I did learn how to style stuff with CSS in more detail and different CSS tags I didn't know about before, which was great! Also, I improved my JS knowledge, :)
